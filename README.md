A blog about Information Security by Tsitsi Flora.


Hi there,

This is my official blog repository. My blog runs on jekyll so it's a static site. I'm not interested in making the blog pretty, but in relaying information more.

Most of the content you will see on this blog are information security related such as box walkthrough's, scripting and developing hacking tools. This blog is entirely driven by my enthusiasm for infosec and the excitement to share that with others, nothing more.

I hope you learn something from what you read here!

Adios
