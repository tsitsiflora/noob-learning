Hi...

My name is Tsitsi Flora and I'm an information security enthusiast. I created this blog entirely out of my excitement to share what I learn with others. It helps me learn more while helping others to figure out some challenges.

All of the articles you'll see here are infosec related, especially machine writethrough's, examples of common kali tools, scripting, building your own tools and much more. My articles are targeted at beginners, noobs who are trying to break into the infosec industry. Hence they will e as explanatory as possible

I will also be sharing my personal experiences on my journey, particularly in preparing for certifications, work in general as well as how to get better at learning new things. There is always something new to learn, you just have to choose what is of most value to you.
